The UF2 image is built for terminal I/O via Serial 1 and 2 on the Sparkfun Thing+ board.
The USB links are also active but the app will not wait for a USB connection.
The USB links work in parallel with the serial ports (use either or both).

ATTN: The repo source code is setup to wait for a USB connection... See Pico_1140.cxx
